Determine if the student's solution is correct or not.

Question:
I'm building a solar power installation and I need \
 help working out the financials. 
- Land costs $100 / square foot
- I can buy solar panels for $250 / square foot
- I negotiated a contract for maintenance that will cost \ 
me a flat $100k per year, and an additional $10 / square \
foot
What is the total cost for the first year of operations 
as a function of the number of square feet.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the size of the installation in square feet.
Costs:
1. Land cost: 100x
2. Solar panel cost: 250x
3. Maintenance cost: 100,000 + 100x
Total cost: 100x + 250x + 100,000 + 100x = 450x + 100,000
